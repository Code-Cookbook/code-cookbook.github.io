# Social Authentication

This recipe will show you how to use social providers like Google, Facebook and more to authenticate users. This recipe is an extension of the [Username & Password recipe](/recipes/users-auth/username-password).

## Ingredients

Most social providers will require the following:

1. Use of their HTML/Javascript libraries
2. Use of their server-side library
3. A developer account and a client ID
4. A configured OAuth Consent Screen

### Google Sign In

Below are links to the **Sign in with Google** versions of the above ingredients.

2. [Server-side libraries](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library)
3. [Account & OAuth Consent Screen setup guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid)

## Considerations

Social login is just another way of authenticating a user instead of using traditional methods like a username and password. Instead of checking the provided credentials against records in the database, you are trusting a third party to verify the user's credentials instead.

Because this now means a user can log in with several different methods, some additional complexity is introduced, in particular these scenarios:

| Problem                                                                                                | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A user registers using a social provider but later wants to sign in with a username/password           | The user can trigger a reset password flow to create a password for their account.                                                                                            |
| A user changes their email address                                                                     | Social login will still work, but they will need to use an account that matches the new email address. The social account they previously used will no longer work            |
| The social provider only returns name and email, more information needs to be captured on registration | A field (e.g `onboarded`) can be added to the User database table. If set to `false`, your app can force the user to complete an additional step before being able to log in. |

## Outputs

### Screens

| Name      | Path   | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login     | /login | Displays the social sign in buttons and redirects to the social provider login screen |
| Dashboard | `/`    | Only accessible if the user has a valid JWT issued. Fetches data from `GET /me`       |

### Endpoints

| Method | Path         | Description                                                   |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /auth/social | Verifies the token from the social provider and issues a JWT. |
| GET    | `/me`        | Returns the current user's details, only if logged in         |

### Tables

```mermaid
erDiagram
  User {
      int id PK
      string email
      string firstName
      string lastName
      string password
      string createdAt
      string updatedAt
  }
```

## Method

### Login page

The login page typically uses one of the social provider's Javascript SDKs

- Google

#### Logic

:::tip
The token issued by the social provider is NOT the same as the token generated by your backend. Your backend should exchange the social token for one you create yourself.
:::

```mermaid
%%{init: { "sequence": { "mirrorActors":false }}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    Frontend->>Frontend: User clicks login button
    Frontend->>+Social: Redirect or popup
    Social-->>-Frontend: Redirect or callback
    Note right of Frontend: Token sent back to frontend
    Frontend->>+API: Login with token
    Note right of API: See 'Social Endpoint' logic below
    API-->>-Frontend: Token (201 Created)
    Note right of Frontend: Browser stores token in cookie
```

### Social Endpoint

The `POST /auth/social` endpoint accepts the token issued by the social provider and returns a JSON web token (JWT) which should be stored by the client for subsequent requests.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "provider": "google",
  "token": {
    "clientId": "719961940556-....apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_id": "719961940556-....apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "credential": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZ...eZv73XtATkZqlEN8z42_Yv4Xr8PwvvnzxKj7NzPkjgNwxvZHL88ari9Sg",
    "select_by": "btn"
  }
}
```

#### Logic

```mermaid
%%{init: { "sequence": { "mirrorActors":false }}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    Frontend->>+API: Login with token
    API->>+Social: Validate token
    Social-->>-API: Success
    API->>API: Handle new user registration
    API->>+JWT: Create and sign new JWT
    Note left of JWT: User ID and email in payload
    JWT-->>-API: Token
    API-->>-Frontend: Token (201 Created)
```

#### Response Body

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    {
      "id": 1234,
      "firstName": "Fred",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "email": "fred@codecookbook.io",
      "createdAt": "2023-04-12T20:07:22.115Z",
      "updatedAt": "2023-04-12T20:07:22.115Z"
    }
  }
}
```
