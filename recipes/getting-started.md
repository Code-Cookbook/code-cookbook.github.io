## About the recipes

Every recipe is designed to be platform and language agnostic, meaning you can apply the principles to your stack, whatever it might be! Example payloads are given in JSON format, but could easily be converted to XML or similar.

Each recipe is structured in the following way
  1. Ingredients: Credentials, technologies, third party accounts and other things you might need to put it all together
  2. Outputs: What to expect when you've finished the recipe. For example; API endpoints, database tables, events, pages
  3. Method: The steps to complete the recipe, broken down into smaller topics
  4. Examples: Fully functional codebases in various languages that you can download. Use them as a starting point or copy+paste them into your own project.
